## About the Book
In today's analytics landscape, proficiency in Excel and Power BI is practically a prerequisite for a successful career. This book provides a concise yet comprehensive exploration of these foundational elements of modern Business Intelligence (BI).

Comprising ten chapters, this book covers the entire development journey of a Power BI analytical solution, spanning from data modeling and preparation to report creation, publication, and dashboard and app deployment. It offers insights into security measures and performance optimization, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of the BI ecosystem. Furthermore, it delves into advanced topics, such as leveraging data science algorithms within reports, offering readers an extensive learning experience. 

The book takes a holistic approach to these technologies, offering a contrast to the narrow perspectives often adopted by contemporary BI professionals who rely solely on a single tool or language. The book allows data enrichment through calculations that can be achieved using various languages, including SQL queries at the source, Power Query Formula Language, M, Python, R, and DAX.
